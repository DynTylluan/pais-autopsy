### Introduction
This document was made as a way for people to easily understand the full autopsy report for Sol Pais. It should be noted that I, Cass Python, am _not_ associated with any of the findings, this report was first made by a third party and this document was based on understanding that I (Python) have understood from the report.

Along with being as a way for people to better understand the autopsy report, this summary was also made as a way to highlight the parts that are important. I like to conciser that I know a lot about copyright in the United Kingdom (my current location and home) and in the United States (where the autopsy report took place), and because of this, as far as I am concerned and aware, the autopsy report made by Dr. Galloway would be in the public domain (no copyright), as it is a work of the US government (on the request of the Clear Creek County Coroner's Office), made as part of that person's official duties. As a work of the US federal government, the report is in the public domain, despite of this, ***this*** document made by Cass Python is not in the public domain, but rather uses a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0).

### Context Behind The Report
To summarise the events surrounding this report, here is the background: **Sol Pais** (2001-02-01 - 2019-04-17), known online as **lonelyangel444** and **dissolvedgirl** on Neocities, was an 18-year-old woman from the United Sates, who was reportedly obsessed with the 1999 Columbine high school massacre, where two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and a teacher. On 2019-04-16, she managed to shut down Columbine High School along with many others, affecting more than 400,000 students in the Denver area, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting, after she made comments in person and online in related to her "`infatuation`" with the shootings.

FBI Denver special agent in charge Dean Phillips said that "`a combination of her actions and comments`" alerted authorities to Pais as a possible threat. Along with the comments, she also purchased three one-way tickets to Denver from Miami for the 15th, 16th, and the 17th of April, before she took the first flight on Monday the 15th. Mr. Phillips said that Sol Pais went directly to legally purchase a pump-action shotgun, along with ammunition.

CBS News reported that nearly 30 armed officers swarm the woods near the Echo Park Campground in the Arapaho National Forest, nearby to where she was reportedly found. Echo Park Campground was not planned to open until late May 2019 due to weather. Witnesses to the event told local media that she was seen running nude and armed with a gun in the area earlier on the in the week.

Clear Creek County Sheriff Rick Albers said that she was found dead when law enforcement officials found her, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot. Her body was removed from the Resthouse Trail near Echo Lake Lodge around 13:30.

### The Report
Dr. Ben Galloway, who also [seemly preformed the autopsy](http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies.php) of [Eric Harris](http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/eric.gif) and [Dylan Klebold](http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/dylan.gif) (the Columbine shooters), along with one of their victims, [Daniel Mauser](http://www.acolumbinesite.com/autopsies/danm.gif), wrote in the report that "`[The] autopsy [took place] in the Clear Creek County Coroner's Office [...] on April 19, 2019`". The examination of the body took three hours "`at the request of Chris Hegmann, the coroner of Clear Creek County. Mr. Hegmann attended the autopsy, assisted [Dr. Galloway] in the autopsy, and identified the decadent to [Dr. Galloway]. [...] Shawna Gilbert, the lead investigator in the case also attended the autopsy`".

As suspected by the media, Pais likely shot herself, the report writes that;

> COMMENT: The autopsy findings in **the case indicate that the cause of death is due to a massive head injury secondary to blunt force trauma sustained from a through-and-through shotgun wound** involving the mouth and an exit wound involving the upper posterior aspect of the left side of the head. A positive scientific identification was established with DNA technology. 

Due to the nature of the circumstances of the events surrounding that of Pais' death, it has been suggested that Pais had some kind of mental illness or condition, however, in the report it says "`No significant past medical history is available at the time of autopsy`" - this _does not_ rule out the possibility that Pais _did_ have any issues on record, but rather that the documents (if there are even any) have not been found or submitted to Clear Creek County Coroner's Office at the time of the autopsy. ddddd

The report makes reference to "`EXTERNAL EXAMINATION`" (meaning what Pais was wearing). Below is a large part of the text, with highlights to parts that are of interest...

> The body is clothed in a long sleeved, blue, gray, and tan flannel plaid shirt bloodstained on the left shoulder. This is consistent with the position of discovery, which is on the decedent's left side. **The body was also clothed in black pants [trousers]** with a black belt with some tissue attached to the upper right thigh; **long sleeve black shirt; black boots; two types of stockings; one of which is a knee-length black sock, the other connected pair consisting of black panties; black hose; black socks, and black lace, brief-type panties. Black gloves with exposed fingers are present on each hand**.

The report carries on by stating that "`The antecubital fossae reveal no evidence of recent needle puncture marks or scars. The upper arms are intact and unremarkable grossly.`", this means that, as you might imagine, this means that Pais had not taken any drugs that you inject into your person, to further this, the report has a subsection dedicated to the toxicology of their person, for full context, here is the section in full;

> **TOXICOLOGY:**
> 
> Blood Alcohol **None detected**
> 
> Urine Alcohol **None detected**
> 
> Vitreous Alcohol **None detected**
> 
> Blood Drug Screen **None detected**

So at lest at the time, Pais was not under the influence of any drugs (legal or other), alcohol (the sate law of Colorado's drinking age is 21; Pais was 18), or even anything else that would be of note.

Dr. Galloway would conduct the internal examination, starting off by doing "`the usual Y-shaped incision`" (cutting up the body, going just past the nipples, then cutting in a literal Y-shape, so that they may view the inside of the body), the report follows off by telling the reader that the internal body of Pais is "intact" and "`seemly normal`". "`The seemly normal`" comment can rather summarise the full report.

The trace evidence subsection states that a "`silver-gray metal"` was found in her person. Trace evidence is made in a post-mortem examination when an objects makes contact with the body of the deceased. The report reads in full;

> TRACE EVIDENCE: I obtained **one flattened lead pellet** measuring 5/8" x 3/8". **This had fallen out of the cranial vault when a head block had been placed underneath the head**. Also falling out was **a piece of silver-gray metal** measuring 5/16" in length, **also a piece of white, which appears to be plastic material**. This is flattened, measuring 1-1/2" x 1" **and had fallen through the base of the skull**.

Page seven of the suggest a second report from Lt. Guggenheim, although this might not be the case at all, and perhaps it is just a misunderstanding of the wording.

> With respect to possible identification by DNA of the decedent, I obtained buccal swabs from the mouth, psoas muscle, and two purple test tubes of blood. **One purple-stoppered test tube of blood is given to Lt. Guggenheim and a second purple-stoppered test tube of blood will be packaged with the toxicology specimens and stored for one year at the ChemaTox toxicology laboratory**.
 
As stated at the start of this overview, when it comes to the report, most things stated in it is not all that unexpected if you have been following the first reports of Pais' death. As guessed, Sol Pais shot herself in the head, killing herself. Her gun was found on her person. She had on dark colours, black trousers, and fingerless gloves.

**End opinions**

This concludes my highlights of the report, as I stated at the start of this report, if you have been following the news revolving around Sol Pais, then the autopsy report document should not hold anything all that suppressing, but it is still interesting to read and review, as you can get an insight glimpse into the details of Pais' death.
