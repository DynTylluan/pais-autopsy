# Sol Pais Autopsy Report

This git is an updated version of [my old report](https://surl.neocities.org/lab/pais/autopsy/) on Sol Pais' autopsy report.

This git has a copy of what is apparently the full autopsy report of Pais, that took place on 2019-04-19, three days after her death. It was found after it was posted on Reddit by user Luca261 [on the dissolvedgirl subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dissolvedgirl/comments/cws1ou).

### Final Autopsy Report
A copy of the final autopsy report is [found here in full](Pais_Autopsy_Report.pdf) with no edits made to it, along with that, a [text version can be found here](autopsy_report_of_sol_pais.txt).

[This git also has a PNG copy of the PDF](autopsy_report_png.md).
